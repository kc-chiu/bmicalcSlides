## Body Mass Index

```{r echo=FALSE}
weight <- 75    # weight in kg
height <- 1.75  # height in m
bmi <- round(weight / height^2, 1)
```

- Body Mass Index (BMI) is for classifying adults' weight
- BMI = weight in kilograms / square of height in meters

### Example
An adult who weighs `r weight`kg and whose height is `r height`m will have a BMI of `r bmi`.

### Calculation for Example
BMI = `r weight`kg / (`r height`m x `r height`m) = `r bmi`

### Note
For convenience of data entry, height input of BMI Calculator application is in cm
